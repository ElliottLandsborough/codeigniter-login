Installation notes:

I recommend installing the demo to get an idea of how the Nested_sets_model is
intended to work. Here are the steps to accomplish this.

ASSUMPTIONS:
You have a working Code Igniter installation already in place. This package has
been tested only with version 1.5.1 of CI but, as far as I'm aware, should work
"out of the box" with previous incarnations.

PROCEDURE:
This package contains the following files:
application/models/Nested_sets_model.php  - The principal file in this package


application/controllers/Categories_demo.php   - Demo controller
application/models/Categories_demo_model.php  - Demo model
application/views/Categories_demo_view.php    - Demo view


Copy all four files into the relevant folders in your Code Igniter installation
and then apply the include .sql file to your database using your favourite method

From the command line, this is:

/path/to/mysql -u mysqluser -ppassword databasename < /path/to/categories_demo.sql

Or you can use phpMyAdmin to load the SQL file accordingly.

Once installed, you should now be able to view the demo by browsing to:

http://www.yoursite.com/index.php/categories_demo

If it works, you're done!

Thunder

MY SETUP
Apache 2.2, PHP 5.2.1, Code Igniter 1.5.1, MySQL 5.2
